# Asteroid

I made an online result system called "Asteroid". It aims to replace the existing website by providing an enhancement over their existing features.
It is a secure system that allows the students to register themselves and view their mark sheets. They can also edit their profile.
Faculties can add and view the student and their mark sheets. Admins can manage details of Students, Faculties, Users, Marksheets, Users & Roles.
